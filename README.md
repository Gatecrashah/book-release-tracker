## 🤖 Automation

### GitHub Actions Workflow
- **Schedule**: Daily at 9:00 AM UTC
- **Triggers**: Manual trigger + code changes
- **Actions**: 
  1. Scrape author pages for new releases
  2. Detect changes and new discoveries
  3. Send email notifications
  4. Update release schedules
  5. Commit changes to repository

### Data Management
- `release_schedules.json` - Automatically managed by GitHub Actions
- `authors.yaml` - Manual configuration (add new authors here)
- Automatic cleanup of releases older than 6 months

## 📊 Adding New Authors

Edit `authors.yaml`:
```yaml
authors:
  - name: "New Author Name"
    book_notification_id: "author-url-slug"
    status: "active"
```

To find the `book_notification_id`:
1. Go to https://www.booknotification.com/
2. Search for your author
3. The URL slug is the ID (e.g., "brandon-sanderson")

## 🛠️ Local Testing

```bash
# Test email configuration
source .env && uv run python email_sender.py

# Test scraper for specific author
uv run python -c "
from scrapers import BookNotificationScraper
scraper = BookNotificationScraper()
books = scraper.scrape_author_releases({'name': 'Brandon Sanderson', 'book_notification_id': 'brandon-sanderson'})
print(f'Found {len(books)} books')
"

# Run full monitoring cycle
source .env && uv run python book_monitor.py
```

## 📈 Monitoring & Logs

- GitHub Actions logs available in repository
- Local logs saved to `book_monitor.log`
- Email delivery tracking via Resend dashboard
- Automatic failure alerts sent to your email

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No books found"**
```bash
# Verify author configuration
uv run python -c "import yaml; print(yaml.safe_load(open('authors.yaml')))"
```

**"Email not sending"**
```bash
# Test email configuration
source .env && uv run python email_sender.py
```

**"Scraper failing"**
- Check GitHub Actions logs
- Verify Book Notification site accessibility
- Update scraper selectors if site structure changed

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Enable debug logging
source .env && uv run python -c "
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
from book_monitor import BookMonitor
monitor = BookMonitor()
monitor.run_monitoring_cycle()
"
```
